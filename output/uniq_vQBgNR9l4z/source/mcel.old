   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.

   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for 'inline void f
   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }', c99 incorrectly complains
   'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function'.
   This bug was observed with Oracle Developer Studio 12.6
   (Sun C 5.15 SunOS_sparc 2017/05/30).

   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
   on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
   from calling static functions (ISO C 99 section 6.7.4.(3).
   This bug is known to occur on:

     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html

     DragonFly; see
     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/clang-master-potential/20141111_102002/logs/ah-tty-0.3.12.log

     FreeBSD; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html

   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
   for clang but remains for g++; see <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.

   GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  It defines a macro
   __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ to indicate this situation or a macro
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate the opposite situation.
   GCC 4.2 with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements the GNU C inline
   semantics but warns, unless -fgnu89-inline is used:
     warning: C99 inline functions are not supported; using GNU89
     warning: to disable this warning use -fgnu89-inline or the gnu_inline function attribute
   It defines a macro __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate this situation.

/* The _GL_ASYNC_SAFE marker should be attached to functions that are

     * All memory locations (variables and struct fields) that these functions
       access must be marked 'volatile'.  This holds for both read and write
       accesses.  Otherwise the compiler might optimize away stores to and
       reads from such locations that occur in the program, depending on its
       data flow analysis.  For example, when the program contains a loop
       that is intended to inspect a variable set from within a signal handler

       the compiler is allowed to transform this into an endless loop if the

   Additionally, recall that:
     * A signal handler should not modify errno (except if it is a handler
       for a fatal signal and ends by raising the same signal again, thus
       provoking the termination of the process).  If it invokes a function
       that may clobber errno, it needs to save and restore the value of

/* alignof (TYPE), also known as _Alignof (TYPE), yields the alignment
   requirement of a structure member (i.e., slot or field) that is of
   type TYPE, as an integer constant expression.

   This differs from GCC's and clang's __alignof__ operator, which can
   yield a better-performing alignment for an object of that type.  For
   example, on x86 with GCC and on Linux/x86 with clang,
   __alignof__ (double) and __alignof__ (long long) are 8, whereas
   alignof (double) and alignof (long long) are 4 unless the option
   '-malign-double' is used.

   The result cannot be used as a value for an 'enum' constant, if you
   want to be portable to HP-UX 10.20 cc and AIX 3.2.5 xlc.  */

/* GCC releases before GCC 4.9 had a bug in _Alignof.  See GCC bug 52023
   <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52023>.
   clang versions < 8.0.0 have the same bug.  */
/* alignas (A), also known as _Alignas (A), aligns a variable or type
   to the alignment A, where A is an integer constant expression.  For
   example:

      int alignas (8) foo;
      struct s { int a; int alignas (8) bar; };

   aligns the address of FOO and the offset of BAR to be multiples of 8.

   A should be a power of two that is at least the type's alignment
   and at most the implementation's alignment limit.  This limit is
   2**28 on typical GNUish hosts, and 2**13 on MSVC.  To be portable
   to MSVC through at least version 10.0, A should be an integer
   constant, as MSVC does not support expressions such as 1 << 3.
   To be portable to Sun C 5.11, do not align auto variables to
   anything stricter than their default alignment.

   The following C23 requirements are not supported here:

     - If A is zero, alignas has no effect.
     - alignas can be used multiple times; the strictest one wins.
     - alignas (TYPE) is equivalent to alignas (alignof (TYPE)).

			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.

   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.

   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */

/* The macros in this file implement multi-byte character representation
   and forward iteration through a multi-byte string.
   They are simpler and can be faster than the mbiter family.
   However, they do not support obsolescent encodings like CP864,
   EBCDIC, Johab, and Shift JIS that glibc also does not support,
   and it is up to the caller to coalesce encoding-error bytes if desired.

   The mcel_scan function lets code iterate through an array of bytes,
   supporting character encodings in practical use
   more simply than using plain mbrtoc32.

   Instead of this single-byte code:

      char *p = ..., *lim = ...;
      for (; p < lim; p++)
        process (*p);

   You can use this multi-byte code:

      char *p = ..., *lim = ...;
      for (mcel_t g; p < lim; p += g.len)
        {
          g = mcel_scan (p, lim);
          process (g);
        }

   You can select from G using G.ch, G.err, and G.len.
   G is an encoding error if G.err is nonzero, a character otherwise.

   The mcel_scanz function is similar except it works with a
   string of unknown but positive length that is terminated with '\0'.
   Instead of this single-byte code:

      char *p = ...;
      for (; *p; p++)
        process (*p);

   You can use this multi-byte code:

      char *p = ...;
      for (mcel_t g; *p; p += g.len)
        {
          g = mcel_scanz (p);
          process (g);
        }

   mcel_scant (P, TERMINATOR) is like mcel_scanz (P) except the
   string is terminated by TERMINATOR.  The C standard says that the
   TERMINATORs '\0', '\r', '\n', '.', '/' are safe, as they cannot be
   a part (even a trailing byte) of a multi-byte character.
   In practice TERMINATOR is safe if 0 <= TERMINATOR <= 0x2f (ASCII '/').

   mcel_ch (CH, LEN) and mcel_err (ERR) construct mcel_t values.

   mcel_cmp (G1, G2) compares two mcel_t values lexicographically by
   character or by encoding byte value, with encoding bytes sorting
   after characters.

   Calls like c32isalpha (G.ch) test G; they return false for encoding
   errors since calls like c32isalpha (0) return false.  Calls like
   mcel_tocmp (c32tolower, G1, G2) are like mcel_cmp (G1, G2),
   but transliterate first.

   Although ISO C and POSIX allow encodings that have shift states or
   that can produce multiple characters from an indivisible byte sequence,
   POSIX does not require support for these encodings,
   they are not in practical use on GNUish platforms,
   and omitting support for them simplifies the API.  */

/* FreeBSD 9.1 <sys/cdefs.h>, included by <stddef.h> and lots of other
   system headers, defines a conflicting _Static_assert that is no
   better than ours; override it.  */





/* Each of these macros verifies that its argument R is nonzero.  To
   be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
   assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.

   If _Static_assert works, verify (R) uses it directly.  Similarly,
   _GL_VERIFY_TRUE works by packaging a _Static_assert inside a struct
   that is an operand of sizeof.

   The code below uses several ideas for C++ compilers, and for C
   compilers that do not support _Static_assert:

   * The first step is ((R) ? 1 : -1).  Given an expression R, of
     integral or boolean or floating-point type, this yields an
     expression of integral type, whose value is later verified to be
     constant and nonnegative.

   * Next this expression W is wrapped in a type
     struct _gl_verify_type {
       unsigned int _gl_verify_error_if_negative: W;
     }.
     If W is negative, this yields a compile-time error.  No compiler can
     deal with a bit-field of negative size.

     One might think that an array size check would have the same
     effect, that is, that the type struct { unsigned int dummy[W]; }
     would work as well.  However, inside a function, some compilers
     (such as C++ compilers and GNU C) allow local parameters and
     variables inside array size expressions.  With these compilers,
     an array size check would not properly diagnose this misuse of
     the verify macro:

       void function (int n) { verify (n < 0); }

   * For the verify macro, the struct _gl_verify_type will need to
     somehow be embedded into a declaration.  To be portable, this
     declaration must declare an object, a constant, a function, or a
     typedef name.  If the declared entity uses the type directly,
     such as in

       struct dummy {...};
       typedef struct {...} dummy;
       extern struct {...} *dummy;
       extern void dummy (struct {...} *);
       extern struct {...} *dummy (void);

     two uses of the verify macro would yield colliding declarations
     if the entity names are not disambiguated.  A workaround is to
     attach the current line number to the entity name:

       #define _GL_CONCAT0(x, y) x##y
       #define _GL_CONCAT(x, y) _GL_CONCAT0 (x, y)
       extern struct {...} * _GL_CONCAT (dummy, __LINE__);

     But this has the problem that two invocations of verify from
     within the same macro would collide, since the __LINE__ value
     would be the same for both invocations.  (The GCC __COUNTER__
     macro solves this problem, but is not portable.)

     A solution is to use the sizeof operator.  It yields a number,
     getting rid of the identity of the type.  Declarations like

       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];

     can be repeated.

   * Should the implementation use a named struct or an unnamed struct?
     Which of the following alternatives can be used?

       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})]);
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];

     In the second and sixth case, the struct type is exported to the
     outer scope; two such declarations therefore collide.  GCC warns
     about the first, third, and fourth cases.  So the only remaining
     possibility is the fifth case:

       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];

   * GCC warns about duplicate declarations of the dummy function if
     -Wredundant-decls is used.  GCC 4.3 and later have a builtin
     __COUNTER__ macro that can let us generate unique identifiers for
     each dummy function, to suppress this warning.

   * This implementation exploits the fact that older versions of GCC,
     which do not support _Static_assert, also do not warn about the
     last declaration mentioned above.

   * GCC warns if -Wnested-externs is enabled and 'verify' is used
     within a function body; but inside a function, you can always
     arrange to use verify_expr instead.

   * In C++, any struct definition inside sizeof is invalid.
     Use a template type to work around the problem.  */

/* _GL_COUNTER is an integer, preferably one that changes each time we
   use it.  Use __COUNTER__ if it works, falling back on __LINE__
   otherwise.  __LINE__ isn't perfect, but it's better than a

/* Verify requirement R at compile-time, as an integer constant expression

/* Verify requirement R at compile-time, as a declaration without a
   trailing ';'.  If R is false, fail at compile-time.

   This macro requires three or more arguments but uses at most the first
   two, so that the _Static_assert macro optionally defined below supports
   both the C11 two-argument syntax and the C23 one-argument syntax.

   Unfortunately, unlike C11, this implementation must appear as an
   ordinary declaration, and cannot appear inside struct { ... }.  */
/* _GL_STATIC_ASSERT_H is defined if this code is copied into assert.h.  */
/* @assert.h omit start@  */
/* Each of these macros verifies that its argument R is nonzero.  To
   be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
   assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.

   There are two macros, since no single macro can be used in all
   contexts in C.  verify_expr (R, E) is for scalar contexts, including
   integer constant expression contexts.  verify (R) is for declaration
   contexts, e.g., the top level.  */

/* Verify requirement R at compile-time.  Return the value of the
   expression E.  */




/* Verify requirement R at compile-time, as a declaration without a
   trailing ';'.  verify (R) acts like static_assert (R) except that
   it is portable to C11/C++14 and earlier, it can issue better
   diagnostics, and its name is shorter and may be more convenient.  */
/* Assume that R always holds.  Behavior is undefined if R is false,
   fails to evaluate, or has side effects.

   'assume (R)' is a directive from the programmer telling the
   compiler that R is true so the compiler needn't generate code to
   test R.  This is why 'assume' is in verify.h: it's related to
   static checking (in this case, static checking done by the
   programmer), not dynamic checking.

   'assume (R)' can affect compilation of all the code, not just code
   that happens to be executed after the assume (R) is "executed".
   For example, if the code mistakenly does 'assert (R); assume (R);'
   the compiler is entitled to optimize away the 'assert (R)'.

   Although assuming R can help a compiler generate better code or
   diagnostics, performance can suffer if R uses hard-to-optimize
   features such as function calls not inlined by the compiler.

   Avoid Clang's __builtin_assume, as it breaks GNU Emacs master
   as of 2020-08-23T21:09:49Z!eggert@cs.ucla.edu; see
   <https://bugs.gnu.org/43152#71>.  It's not known whether this breakage

   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "literal string") issues a declaration
   for FUNCTION which will then trigger a compiler warning containing
   the text of "literal string" anywhere that function is called, if
   supported by the compiler.  If the compiler does not support this
   feature, the macro expands to an unused extern declaration.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("literal string") expands to the
   attribute used in _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  If the compiler does not support
   this feature, it expands to empty.

   These macros are useful for marking a function as a potential
   portability trap, with the intent that "literal string" include
   instructions on the replacement function that should be used
   instead.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is for functions with 'extern' linkage.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE is for functions with 'static' or 'inline'
   linkage.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE should not be used more than once for a given function
   in a given compilation unit (because this may generate a warning even
   if the function is never called).

   However, one of the reasons that a function is a portability trap is
   if it has the wrong signature.  Declaring FUNCTION with a different
   signature in C is a compilation error, so this macro must use the
   same type as any existing declaration so that programs that avoid
   the problematic FUNCTION do not fail to compile merely because they
   included a header that poisoned the function.  But this implies that
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is only safe to use if FUNCTION is known to already
   have a declaration.  Use of this macro implies that there must not
   be any other macro hiding the declaration of FUNCTION; but
   undefining FUNCTION first is part of the poisoning process anyway
   (although for symbols that are provided only via a macro, the result
   is a compilation error rather than a warning containing
   "literal string").  Also note that in C++, it is only safe to use if
   FUNCTION has no overloads.

   For an example, it is possible to poison 'getline' by:
   - adding a call to gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE([[#include <stdio.h>]],
     [getline]) in configure.ac, which potentially defines
     HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
   - adding this code to a header that wraps the system <stdio.h>:
     #undef getline
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (getline, "getline is required by POSIX 2008, but"
       "not universally present; use the gnulib module getline");
     #endif

   It is not possible to directly poison global variables.  But it is
   possible to write a wrapper accessor function, and poison that
   (less common usage, like &environ, will cause a compilation error
   rather than issue the nice warning, but the end result of informing
   the developer about their portability problem is still achieved):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (rpl_environ, "environ is not always properly declared");
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   or better (avoiding contradictory use of 'static' and 'extern'):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("environ is not always properly declared")
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   */
/* Another compiler attribute is available in clang.  */
/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE_CXX (function, rettype_gcc, rettype_clang, parameters_and_attributes, "message")
   is like _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "message"), except that in C++ mode the
   function is declared with the given prototype, consisting of return type,
   parameters, and attributes.
   This variant is useful for overloaded functions in C++. _GL_WARN_ON_USE does
   not work in this case.  */

/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "literal string") issues a declaration
   for FUNCTION which will then trigger a compiler warning containing
   the text of "literal string" anywhere that function is called, if
   supported by the compiler.  If the compiler does not support this
   feature, the macro expands to an unused extern declaration.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("literal string") expands to the
   attribute used in _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  If the compiler does not support
   this feature, it expands to empty.

   These macros are useful for marking a function as a potential
   portability trap, with the intent that "literal string" include
   instructions on the replacement function that should be used
   instead.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is for functions with 'extern' linkage.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE is for functions with 'static' or 'inline'
   linkage.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE should not be used more than once for a given function
   in a given compilation unit (because this may generate a warning even
   if the function is never called).

   However, one of the reasons that a function is a portability trap is
   if it has the wrong signature.  Declaring FUNCTION with a different
   signature in C is a compilation error, so this macro must use the
   same type as any existing declaration so that programs that avoid
   the problematic FUNCTION do not fail to compile merely because they
   included a header that poisoned the function.  But this implies that
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is only safe to use if FUNCTION is known to already
   have a declaration.  Use of this macro implies that there must not
   be any other macro hiding the declaration of FUNCTION; but
   undefining FUNCTION first is part of the poisoning process anyway
   (although for symbols that are provided only via a macro, the result
   is a compilation error rather than a warning containing
   "literal string").  Also note that in C++, it is only safe to use if
   FUNCTION has no overloads.

   For an example, it is possible to poison 'getline' by:
   - adding a call to gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE([[#include <stdio.h>]],
     [getline]) in configure.ac, which potentially defines
     HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
   - adding this code to a header that wraps the system <stdio.h>:
     #undef getline
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (getline, "getline is required by POSIX 2008, but"
       "not universally present; use the gnulib module getline");
     #endif

   It is not possible to directly poison global variables.  But it is
   possible to write a wrapper accessor function, and poison that
   (less common usage, like &environ, will cause a compilation error
   rather than issue the nice warning, but the end result of informing
   the developer about their portability problem is still achieved):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (rpl_environ, "environ is not always properly declared");
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   or better (avoiding contradictory use of 'static' and 'extern'):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("environ is not always properly declared")
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   */
/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE_CXX (function, rettype_gcc, rettype_clang, parameters_and_attributes, "message")

/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "literal string") issues a declaration
   for FUNCTION which will then trigger a compiler warning containing
   the text of "literal string" anywhere that function is called, if
   supported by the compiler.  If the compiler does not support this
   feature, the macro expands to an unused extern declaration.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("literal string") expands to the
   attribute used in _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  If the compiler does not support
   this feature, it expands to empty.

   These macros are useful for marking a function as a potential
   portability trap, with the intent that "literal string" include
   instructions on the replacement function that should be used
   instead.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is for functions with 'extern' linkage.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE is for functions with 'static' or 'inline'
   linkage.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE should not be used more than once for a given function
   in a given compilation unit (because this may generate a warning even
   if the function is never called).

   However, one of the reasons that a function is a portability trap is
   if it has the wrong signature.  Declaring FUNCTION with a different
   signature in C is a compilation error, so this macro must use the
   same type as any existing declaration so that programs that avoid
   the problematic FUNCTION do not fail to compile merely because they
   included a header that poisoned the function.  But this implies that
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is only safe to use if FUNCTION is known to already
   have a declaration.  Use of this macro implies that there must not
   be any other macro hiding the declaration of FUNCTION; but
   undefining FUNCTION first is part of the poisoning process anyway
   (although for symbols that are provided only via a macro, the result
   is a compilation error rather than a warning containing
   "literal string").  Also note that in C++, it is only safe to use if
   FUNCTION has no overloads.

   For an example, it is possible to poison 'getline' by:
   - adding a call to gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE([[#include <stdio.h>]],
     [getline]) in configure.ac, which potentially defines
     HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
   - adding this code to a header that wraps the system <stdio.h>:
     #undef getline
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (getline, "getline is required by POSIX 2008, but"
       "not universally present; use the gnulib module getline");
     #endif

   It is not possible to directly poison global variables.  But it is
   possible to write a wrapper accessor function, and poison that
   (less common usage, like &environ, will cause a compilation error
   rather than issue the nice warning, but the end result of informing
   the developer about their portability problem is still achieved):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (rpl_environ, "environ is not always properly declared");
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   or better (avoiding contradictory use of 'static' and 'extern'):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("environ is not always properly declared")
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   */
