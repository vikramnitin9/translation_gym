   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.

   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for 'inline void f
   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }', c99 incorrectly complains
   'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function'.
   This bug was observed with Oracle Developer Studio 12.6
   (Sun C 5.15 SunOS_sparc 2017/05/30).

   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
   on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
   from calling static functions (ISO C 99 section 6.7.4.(3).
   This bug is known to occur on:

     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html

     DragonFly; see
     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/clang-master-potential/20141111_102002/logs/ah-tty-0.3.12.log

     FreeBSD; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html

   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
   for clang but remains for g++; see <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.

   GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  It defines a macro
   __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ to indicate this situation or a macro
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate the opposite situation.
   GCC 4.2 with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements the GNU C inline
   semantics but warns, unless -fgnu89-inline is used:
     warning: C99 inline functions are not supported; using GNU89
     warning: to disable this warning use -fgnu89-inline or the gnu_inline function attribute
   It defines a macro __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate this situation.

/* The _GL_ASYNC_SAFE marker should be attached to functions that are

     * All functions that it calls should be marked _GL_ASYNC_SAFE as well,
       or should be listed as async-signal-safe in POSIX
       <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_04>
       section 2.4.3.  Note that malloc(), sprintf(), and fwrite(), in
       particular, are NOT async-signal-safe.
     * All memory locations (variables and struct fields) that these functions
       access must be marked 'volatile'.  This holds for both read and write
       accesses.  Otherwise the compiler might optimize away stores to and
       reads from such locations that occur in the program, depending on its
       data flow analysis.  For example, when the program contains a loop
       that is intended to inspect a variable set from within a signal handler
           while (!signal_occurred)
             ;
       the compiler is allowed to transform this into an endless loop if the

   Additionally, recall that:
     * A signal handler should not modify errno (except if it is a handler
       for a fatal signal and ends by raising the same signal again, thus
       provoking the termination of the process).  If it invokes a function
       that may clobber errno, it needs to save and restore the value of
       errno.  */

/* alignof (TYPE), also known as _Alignof (TYPE), yields the alignment
   requirement of a structure member (i.e., slot or field) that is of
   type TYPE, as an integer constant expression.

   This differs from GCC's and clang's __alignof__ operator, which can
   yield a better-performing alignment for an object of that type.  For
   example, on x86 with GCC and on Linux/x86 with clang,
   __alignof__ (double) and __alignof__ (long long) are 8, whereas
   alignof (double) and alignof (long long) are 4 unless the option
   '-malign-double' is used.

   The result cannot be used as a value for an 'enum' constant, if you
   want to be portable to HP-UX 10.20 cc and AIX 3.2.5 xlc.  */

/* GCC releases before GCC 4.9 had a bug in _Alignof.  See GCC bug 52023
   <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52023>.
   clang versions < 8.0.0 have the same bug.  */
/* alignas (A), also known as _Alignas (A), aligns a variable or type
   to the alignment A, where A is an integer constant expression.  For
   example:

      int alignas (8) foo;
      struct s { int a; int alignas (8) bar; };

   aligns the address of FOO and the offset of BAR to be multiples of 8.

   A should be a power of two that is at least the type's alignment
   and at most the implementation's alignment limit.  This limit is
   2**28 on typical GNUish hosts, and 2**13 on MSVC.  To be portable
   to MSVC through at least version 10.0, A should be an integer
   constant, as MSVC does not support expressions such as 1 << 3.
   To be portable to Sun C 5.11, do not align auto variables to
   anything stricter than their default alignment.

   The following C23 requirements are not supported here:

     - If A is zero, alignas has no effect.
     - alignas can be used multiple times; the strictest one wins.
     - alignas (TYPE) is equivalent to alignas (alignof (TYPE)).

			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */

   added in 2.0.  */







/* Similarly for clang.  Features added to GCC after version 4.2 may
   or may not also be available in clang, and clang's definitions of
   __GNUC(_MINOR)__ are fixed at 4 and 2 respectively.  Not all such
   features can be queried via __has_extension/__has_feature.  */

/* If none of the ANSI/POSIX macros are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE
   is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
   _XOPEN_SOURCE).  */
/* Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be
   defined in all multithreaded code.  GNU libc has not required this
   for many years.  We now treat them as compatibility synonyms for
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L, which is the earliest level of POSIX with
   comprehensive support for multithreaded code.  Using them never
   lowers the selected level of POSIX conformance, only raises it.  */
/* The function 'gets' existed in C89, but is impossible to use
   safely.  It has been removed from ISO C11 and ISO C++14.  Note: for
   compatibility with various implementations of <cstdio>, this test
   must consider only the value of __cplusplus when compiling C++.  */






/* GNU formerly extended the scanf functions with modified format
   specifiers %as, %aS, and %a[...] that allocate a buffer for the
   input using malloc.  This extension conflicts with ISO C99, which
   defines %a as a standalone format specifier that reads a floating-
   point number; moreover, POSIX.1-2008 provides the same feature
   using the modifier letter 'm' instead (%ms, %mS, %m[...]).

   We now follow C99 unless GNU extensions are active and the compiler
   is specifically in C89 or C++98 mode (strict or not).  For
   instance, with GCC, -std=gnu11 will have C99-compliant scanf with
   or without -D_GNU_SOURCE, but -std=c89 -D_GNU_SOURCE will have the
   old extension.  */

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "literal string") issues a declaration
   for FUNCTION which will then trigger a compiler warning containing
   the text of "literal string" anywhere that function is called, if
   supported by the compiler.  If the compiler does not support this
   feature, the macro expands to an unused extern declaration.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("literal string") expands to the
   attribute used in _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  If the compiler does not support
   this feature, it expands to empty.

   These macros are useful for marking a function as a potential
   portability trap, with the intent that "literal string" include
   instructions on the replacement function that should be used
   instead.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is for functions with 'extern' linkage.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE is for functions with 'static' or 'inline'
   linkage.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE should not be used more than once for a given function
   in a given compilation unit (because this may generate a warning even
   if the function is never called).

   However, one of the reasons that a function is a portability trap is
   if it has the wrong signature.  Declaring FUNCTION with a different
   signature in C is a compilation error, so this macro must use the
   same type as any existing declaration so that programs that avoid
   the problematic FUNCTION do not fail to compile merely because they
   included a header that poisoned the function.  But this implies that
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is only safe to use if FUNCTION is known to already
   have a declaration.  Use of this macro implies that there must not
   be any other macro hiding the declaration of FUNCTION; but
   undefining FUNCTION first is part of the poisoning process anyway
   (although for symbols that are provided only via a macro, the result
   is a compilation error rather than a warning containing
   "literal string").  Also note that in C++, it is only safe to use if
   FUNCTION has no overloads.

   For an example, it is possible to poison 'getline' by:
   - adding a call to gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE([[#include <stdio.h>]],
     [getline]) in configure.ac, which potentially defines
     HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
   - adding this code to a header that wraps the system <stdio.h>:
     #undef getline
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (getline, "getline is required by POSIX 2008, but"
       "not universally present; use the gnulib module getline");
     #endif

   It is not possible to directly poison global variables.  But it is
   possible to write a wrapper accessor function, and poison that
   (less common usage, like &environ, will cause a compilation error
   rather than issue the nice warning, but the end result of informing
   the developer about their portability problem is still achieved):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (rpl_environ, "environ is not always properly declared");
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   or better (avoiding contradictory use of 'static' and 'extern'):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("environ is not always properly declared")
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   */
/* Another compiler attribute is available in clang.  */
/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE_CXX (function, rettype_gcc, rettype_clang, parameters_and_attributes, "message")
   is like _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "message"), except that in C++ mode the
   function is declared with the given prototype, consisting of return type,
   parameters, and attributes.
   This variant is useful for overloaded functions in C++. _GL_WARN_ON_USE does
   not work in this case.  */

  /* KIND must stay at this position in the structure to maintain
     binary compatibility with static initializers.

     Concurrency notes:
     The __kind of a mutex is initialized either by the static
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER or by a call to pthread_mutex_init.

     After a mutex has been initialized, the __kind of a mutex is usually not
     changed.  BUT it can be set to -1 in pthread_mutex_destroy or elision can
     be enabled.  This is done concurrently in the pthread_mutex_*lock
     functions by using the macro FORCE_ELISION. This macro is only defined
     for architectures which supports lock elision.

     For elision, there are the flags PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP and
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP which can be set in addition to the already
     set type of a mutex.  Before a mutex is initialized, only
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP can be set with pthread_mutexattr_settype.

     After a mutex has been initialized, the functions pthread_mutex_*lock can
     enable elision - if the mutex-type and the machine supports it - by
     setting the flag PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP. This is done concurrently.
     Afterwards the lock / unlock functions are using specific elision
     code-paths.  */

/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "literal string") issues a declaration
   for FUNCTION which will then trigger a compiler warning containing
   the text of "literal string" anywhere that function is called, if
   supported by the compiler.  If the compiler does not support this
   feature, the macro expands to an unused extern declaration.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("literal string") expands to the
   attribute used in _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  If the compiler does not support
   this feature, it expands to empty.

   These macros are useful for marking a function as a potential
   portability trap, with the intent that "literal string" include
   instructions on the replacement function that should be used
   instead.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is for functions with 'extern' linkage.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE is for functions with 'static' or 'inline'
   linkage.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE should not be used more than once for a given function
   in a given compilation unit (because this may generate a warning even
   if the function is never called).

   However, one of the reasons that a function is a portability trap is
   if it has the wrong signature.  Declaring FUNCTION with a different
   signature in C is a compilation error, so this macro must use the
   same type as any existing declaration so that programs that avoid
   the problematic FUNCTION do not fail to compile merely because they
   included a header that poisoned the function.  But this implies that
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is only safe to use if FUNCTION is known to already
   have a declaration.  Use of this macro implies that there must not
   be any other macro hiding the declaration of FUNCTION; but
   undefining FUNCTION first is part of the poisoning process anyway
   (although for symbols that are provided only via a macro, the result
   is a compilation error rather than a warning containing
   "literal string").  Also note that in C++, it is only safe to use if
   FUNCTION has no overloads.

   For an example, it is possible to poison 'getline' by:
   - adding a call to gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE([[#include <stdio.h>]],
     [getline]) in configure.ac, which potentially defines
     HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
   - adding this code to a header that wraps the system <stdio.h>:
     #undef getline
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (getline, "getline is required by POSIX 2008, but"
       "not universally present; use the gnulib module getline");
     #endif

   It is not possible to directly poison global variables.  But it is
   possible to write a wrapper accessor function, and poison that
   (less common usage, like &environ, will cause a compilation error
   rather than issue the nice warning, but the end result of informing
   the developer about their portability problem is still achieved):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (rpl_environ, "environ is not always properly declared");
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   or better (avoiding contradictory use of 'static' and 'extern'):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("environ is not always properly declared")
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   */
/* _GL_WARN_ON_USE_CXX (function, rettype_gcc, rettype_clang, parameters_and_attributes, "message")
   is like _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "message"), except that in C++ mode the
   function is declared with the given prototype, consisting of return type,
   parameters, and attributes.
   This variant is useful for overloaded functions in C++. _GL_WARN_ON_USE does
   not work in this case.  */

/* The type 'idx_t' holds an (array) index or an (object) size.
   Its implementation promotes to a signed integer type,
   which can hold the values
     0..2^63-1 (on 64-bit platforms) or
     0..2^31-1 (on 32-bit platforms).

   Why a signed integer type?

     * Security: Signed types can be checked for overflow via
       '-fsanitize=undefined', but unsigned types cannot.

     * Comparisons without surprises: ISO C99 § 6.3.1.8 specifies a few
       surprising results for comparisons, such as

           (int) -3 < (unsigned long) 7  =>  false
           (int) -3 < (unsigned int) 7   =>  false
       and on 32-bit machines:
           (long) -3 < (unsigned int) 7  =>  false

       This is surprising because the natural comparison order is by
       value in the realm of infinite-precision signed integers (ℤ).

       The best way to get rid of such surprises is to use signed types
       for numerical integer values, and use unsigned types only for
       bit masks and enums.

   Why not use 'size_t' directly?

     * Because 'size_t' is an unsigned type, and a signed type is better.
       See above.

   Why not use 'ssize_t'?

     * 'ptrdiff_t' is more portable; it is standardized by ISO C
       whereas 'ssize_t' is standardized only by POSIX.

     * 'ssize_t' is not required to be as wide as 'size_t', and some
       now-obsolete POSIX platforms had 'size_t' wider than 'ssize_t'.

     * Conversely, some now-obsolete platforms had 'ptrdiff_t' wider
       than 'size_t', which can be a win and conforms to POSIX.

   Won't this cause a problem with objects larger than PTRDIFF_MAX?

     * Typical modern or large platforms do not allocate such objects,
       so this is not much of a problem in practice; for example, you
       can safely write 'idx_t len = strlen (s);'.  To port to older
       small platforms where allocations larger than PTRDIFF_MAX could
       in theory be a problem, you can use Gnulib's ialloc module, or
       functions like ximalloc in Gnulib's xalloc module.

   Why not use 'ptrdiff_t' directly?

     * Maintainability: When reading and modifying code, it helps to know that
       a certain variable cannot have negative values.  For example, when you
       have a loop

         int n = ...;
         for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) ...

       or

         ptrdiff_t n = ...;
         for (ptrdiff_t i = 0; i < n; i++) ...

       you have to ask yourself "what if n < 0?".  Whereas in

         idx_t n = ...;
         for (idx_t i = 0; i < n; i++) ...

       you know that this case cannot happen.

       Similarly, when a programmer writes

         idx_t = ptr2 - ptr1;

       there is an implied assertion that ptr1 and ptr2 point into the same
       object and that ptr1 <= ptr2.

     * Being future-proof: In the future, range types (integers which are
       constrained to a certain range of values) may be added to C compilers
       or to the C standard.  Several programming languages (Ada, Haskell,
       Common Lisp, Pascal) already have range types.  Such range types may
       help producing good code and good warnings.  The type 'idx_t' could
       then be typedef'ed to a range type that is signed after promotion.  */






/* In the future, idx_t could be typedef'ed to a signed range type.
   The clang "extended integer types", supported in Clang 11 or newer
   <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#extended-integer-types>,
   are a special case of range types.  However, these types don't support binary
   operators with plain integer types (e.g. expressions such as x > 1).
   Therefore, they don't behave like signed types (and not like unsigned types
   either).  So, we cannot use them here.  */

/* Use the signed type 'ptrdiff_t'.  */
/* Note: ISO C does not mandate that 'size_t' and 'ptrdiff_t' have the same
   size, but it is so on all platforms we have seen since 1990.  */
typedef ptrdiff_t idx_t;

/* IDX_MAX is the maximum value of an idx_t.  */


/* So far no need has been found for an IDX_WIDTH macro.
   Perhaps there should be another macro IDX_VALUE_BITS that does not
   count the sign bit and is therefore one less than PTRDIFF_WIDTH.  */
