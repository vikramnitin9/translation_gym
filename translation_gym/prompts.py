As far as possible, avoid raw pointers and unsafe function calls, and use only safe Rust. Also avoid libc types and use Rust native types instead.
You can assume that all the structures and global variables already have definitions in Rust, and you do not need to redefine them.
Do not use any dummy code like "// Full implementation goes here", etc. All the code you write will be substituted directly into the codebase without a human reviewing it. So it should be functional and complete.
Feel free to change the function signature and modify the function body as needed.
If you need imports, you can add them in the <IMPORTS>...</IMPORTS> section. Do not provide them along with the function body.
{importDesc}
{globalDesc}

Also provide a wrapper function that calls this function.
The wrapper function should have the *same* arguments and return type as the C function, except with C types replaced with their corresponding libc crate types.
For example, replace `int` with `libc::c_int`, `char*` with `*mut libc::c_char`, etc.
Also remember to use `#[no_mangle]` and `pub extern "C" fn ...` for the wrapper function.
{wrapperDesc} 

The name of the Rust function should be `{func['name']}_rust` and the wrapper function should be `{func['name']}`.

Follow this format:

<IMPORTS>
Any imports you need for {func['name']}_rust and {func['name']}. Can be empty.
</IMPORTS>

<FUNC>
fn {func['name']}_rust ...
</FUNC>

<WRAPPER>
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn {func['name']} ...
</WRAPPER>

The struct should be a `struct` in Rust, and the fields should be `pub` so that they can be accessed from outside the module.
The name of the Rust struct should be `{struct['name']}_rust`.
Make sure to use idiomatic Rust types instead of C types. Avoid libc types and use Rust native types instead.
For example, replace `int` with `i32`, `char*` with `String`, etc.
If you need imports, you can add them in the <IMPORTS>...</IMPORTS> section. Do not provide them along with the struct source.
